Quintin here, I am a senior at Fairmont State University majoring in Business Information Systems Management. I have learned a couple programming languages throughout my education such as: Java, Visual Basic, and C#. I have also messed around with C++, HTML, and Linux but I'm by no means an expert in these languages.
